Test your solution and demonstrate that it works as explect. If a problem's solution is eluding you, practice solving problems in the same way as in class, make a plan and decompose it into smaller parts before coding.

    "- Writing small, focused functions\n",
    "- Using conditionals and loops to analyze program state\n",
